# The-Occult-Process-Without-Mysticism
My research book covering the occult knowledge

This book is a second revision of the research I am conducting. Itâ€™s a work in progress: as I learn more, I update this book accordingly.

Described on these pages are the methods and processes how real occultists are affecting our world today. The occult process revealed on these pages is so far progressed in our world that if I simply directly explain what is real and how things actually work, they might not mean anything to the reader. Even worse, the reader could probably think that the presented facts cannot possibly be true based on what the reader already believes to know about occultism. Thus it is important to provide some of the experiments and observations first, so the reader can understand what exactly lead to these undeniable conclusions about the nature of our reality and the people using this knowledge. This way it is possible to uncover all of it, layer by layer, so the reader can truly understand how deep the deception goes. Because of this I implore the reader not to ignore or skip reading the sections describing the experiments which have lead to these conclusions. They are essential part of the research which the reader can also perform and confirm on her own. This enables the reader to see if she comes to the exact same conclusions as have been written on these pages.

What I care about is the truth which has been hidden from most of the humanity, which made it possible to oppress people using covert spiritual methods. I want to uncover the truth, study it and expose it to people in its purest possible form so everyone can benefit from this knowledge. Truth will help humanity get free from oppression and will hopefully eradicate the covert grasp on humanity entirely. Instead of hiding this knowledge for the benefit of the select few, it is in all of our best interest to crowdsource this project. Blessed is he who seeks the truth and convinces others to do so. This is why you should care to study these topics and if you feel the calling, you can hopefully help me progress this work. And remember: which is unknown can hurt you the most. So always be careful while conducting your own research.
